# Household Power Consumption - Multivariate Time Series

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that explores and analyzes household power consumption data as a multivariate time series. The dataset provides minute-by-minute measurements of electrical power consumption.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to create deeplearning model  on household power consumption data. The notebook includes data preprocessing, and modeling techniques to handle and analyze the multivariate time series data.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains measurements of:
- Global Active Power
- Global Reactive Power
- Voltage
- Global Intensity
- Sub Metering 1, 2, and 3

The data is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and is available [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Individual+household+electric+power+consumption).
